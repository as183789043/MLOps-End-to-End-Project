## Project Overview
This project leverages an XGBoost model to predict employee turnover within the next two years. It offers a streamlined solution for the entire workflowâ€”from development to deployment. By simply uploading the code, developers can automatically trigger a pipeline that handles model training, validation, and deployment to a serverless environment on GCP. The frontend, powered by Streamlit Cloud, continuously monitors specific GitHub repository paths for code changes, ensuring that the web interface is automatically updated and deployed with each modification.
